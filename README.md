## What is it?

A place for freelancers, contractors, creatives and makers; bakers, gardeners, painters and carpenters. A place where you swap what you have, for what you need. 

Small business owners know - getting your dream off the ground no longer requires a flyer and a prayer. It requires a crack team of marketeers, influencers, events (catered) and an online, all round presence. 

Not just a website but an app. Not just a market stall, but an online ecommerce store. Not just a hero shot, but a photoshoot. 

Our dreams are our passion, and what we're really damn good at. 

But we cant do it on our own. And now more that ever, no man is an island. 

So here in this app, is where you can - exchange what you can offer, for what your business really needs. 

So go ahead, take a look - it wont cost you a dime. All we ask in return, is that what you get out, you put back in!
